# KoriApp ‚òëÔ∏è
A small practice project i developed triyng to create my own social network where I could upload photographs, done with .NET MAUI in honor of a good friend's birthday (That's where the name of the app comes from).  
- Warning: It is meant to be used on mobile devices, so if it is run on desktop version, the user experience may be limited/impeded.
# Features üîç
For data storage it uses a full Firebase Hosting with a NoSQL RealTime DataBase, a file storage and email authentication.

In KoriApp You can:
* Create a profile with an email, username, profile photo and password.
* Login with your email and password.
* Upload photos with a Description and Hashtag.
* Watch, like and comment another's user publications on the MainPage.
* Visit the profile of another users, where you can find all the publications made by them.

# Current and future status ‚öôÔ∏è
I've only spent a week on this project, so it still has a lot of bugs and security problems, but my intention was just to create something quick to give to my friend.
But certainly in the future I would like to continue working on it to polish some things and add some features that I would like to implement.

To-do list:
* Add the option to change the profile photo and UserName.
* Be able to see who has liked a post.
* Give more customization options to profiles (such as colors or description.)
* Correctly implement image deletion from the database.
* Auto login every time the app is opened once you have already logged in before.
* Login with username instead of email.
* Add temporary statuses that expire after a day (yes, like Instagram stories.)
* Delete/edit comments on posts
* Add notifications for when someone likes/comments on a post.
