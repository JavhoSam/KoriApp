# KoriApp
A small practice project where I tried to create my own social network where I could upload photographs, done with .NET MAUI in honor of a good friend's birthday (That's where the name of the app comes from).  Warning: It is made to be used on mobile devices, so if it is run on the desktop version, the user experience may be limited/impeded
